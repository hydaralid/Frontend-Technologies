HTML Web Design using,
1. Hyperlinks (<a> tag>)
2. Tables

1. Hyperlinks (<a> tag>
   Hyperlinks, also known as links, are a fundamental element of HTML that enable navigation between different web pages, sections of the same page, or other resources on the web. They are created using the <a> (anchor) tag.
   Syntax: <a href="URL">Link Text</a>

2. Tables
   Tables in HTML are used to organize and display data in rows and columns. They are created using the <table> element, with rows defined by <tr> (table row) and cells within rows defined by <td> (table data) or <th> (table header).
   Syntax: <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Header 1</th>
    <th>Header 2</th>
    <th>Header 3</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data 1</td>
    <td>Data 2</td>
    <td>Data 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>
